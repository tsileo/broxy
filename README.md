# Development

Here is a sample local development file, the trick is to listen to localhost and use the same address to bind an app.

```yaml
auto_tls: false
listen: 'localhost:8020'
apps:
 - id: 'blog'
   domains:
    - 'localhost:8020'
   proxy: 'http://localhost:5005/'
   cache:
     cache_proxy: true
     time: 12h
```
